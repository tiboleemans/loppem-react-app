## FRONTEND STYLING
### GENERAL
* Make mobile friendly (later phase)

### VACATIONS
* Make video playable
  * --swiper-pagination-top: 10px; in App.css causes this
* Swiper bundle styling loaded with index.html
  * "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css" is die nodig?

### Inscription

  * Numbers in stepper are black and should by white on selection like the check after completion 
  * CustomSelect has a black border


## REMARKS
