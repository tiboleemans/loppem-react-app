After lunch, the pupils can freshen up briefly in their rooms, and then the animators challenge them in sporting or creative ways during activities that take place outdoors whenever possible. Afterwards, the teachers are already eager to continue working with the pupils. Then it is time for the afternoon snack and another relaxing activity to let off some steam. After dinner, pupils can pick an active or quiet activity of their choice and spend time with their friends. After a refreshing shower, pupils crawl under the covers.",
      "content.card.4.title": "Which activities and excursions are there?",
      "content.card.4.body": "There is a daily dose of sports and games on the abbey school domain: think ball games on our sports fields, the much-loved water and paint games, an escape game, quiz, laser tag, crafts for the littlest ones, karaoke and musical shows (swing palace and free stage), a night game for the oldest pupils, a casino night and of course a number of surprises! We also leave the domain several times. We take the whole group on a trip to the historic city centre of nearby Bruges, where we let the pupils discover the city during a challenging city quest. Pupils interact with shopkeepers during this quest and can boost their confidence in their chosen target language. It is great for the pupils to notice during these interactions that they manage to speak comfortably in the target language with native speakers. It has also become an annual tradition to go swimming with the pupils at a nearby swimming pool.",
      "content.card.5.title": "What is the policy with mobile phones?",
      "content.card.5.body": "We understand that students like to take their mobile phones with them on camp to keep in touch with the home front from time to time, although they absolutely do not need mobile phones during our language holidays. We make every effort to motivate the students to make as many friends as possible and thus practise their chosen target language as much as possible in a relaxed manner. As an organisation, we feel that having a mobile phone in your pocket does not help in this respect, which is why we ask students to leave their mobile phones in their rooms whenever possible. We have noticed over the years that students actually really enjoy taking a break from their mobile phones and social media and being able to fully concentrate on daily life at camp.",
      "content.card.6.title": "How are the class groups formed?",
      "content.card.6.body": "We form class groups of up to 10 pupils on the first day of the language holiday based on age, prior knowledge and fluency in the target language. For 2 hours, the teacher will work with the pupils in different work formats (both group and individual) to assess their real skills as best as possible. We also take into account the social dynamics here, which is crucial to offer each child a pleasant learning experience. Naturally, we closely monitor the pupils' evolution and growth throughout the language holidays and, if necessary, adjust the group formation in close consultation with the pupil, the teacher and the organisation.",
      "content.card.7.title": "How do I stay informed during the camp?",
      "content.card.7.body": "We enthusiastically welcome you on the first day of the language holiday. At that time, as a parent or guardian, you can get to know us better as a team and take a tour of the domain. You can accompany your child to the room to unpack quietly. After the first day of the language holiday, we will send you a link to a photo album in which we post many photos of the activities, lessons and moments of relaxation every day. This is how we try to let parents and guardians enjoy what goes on at camp. Every year it is nice to see that we get a lot of positive reactions to the album. At the end of the language holiday, we gladly welcome parents or guardians to discuss the pupils' experiences and skills during a parent meeting in which we also give a personal report with tips & tricks."
